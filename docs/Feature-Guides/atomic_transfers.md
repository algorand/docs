Atomic Transfers are irreducible batch operations that allow a group of [transactions](../features/transactions.md) to be submitted as a unit. All transactions in the batch either pass or fail. The batch operation will only be successful if each transaction within the group is successful.

Transactions can contain Alogs or Algorand Assets and may also be governed by Algorand Smart Contracts. 

Individual transactions are first created and then grouped into a file. The file is then singed individually by the originators within the group. This file is then submitted to the network, where the node verifies the transactions and submits them all at once. This eliminates the need for hashed time-locks for atomic swaps in other blockchains and also avoids the delays inherent with hashed timed-locks.
Atomic Transfers enable applications such as: 

* Circular trades: Alice pays Bob if and only if Bob pays Clare if and only if Clare pays Alice
* Group payments: Group funding where everyone pays or none pay.
* Decentralized exchanges: Atomic multi-party transfers require no trusted intermediaries.
* Distributed payments: Payments to multiple recipients


Atomic Transfers are Created with the following steps:

* Create unsigned transactions and save to file
* Combine transactions into one file
* Group transactions
* Sign the grouped transaction with private keys
* Submit signed grouped transaction file to the network

Below you will find examples for creating group transactions and sending them to the network in each of the available SDKs. The same capability is also shown using the `goal` command-line tool. The example code is separated into snippets categorized by these core functions.
# Create transactions
Transaction creation functions are described in the [Transactions](../features/transactions.md) documentation. Atomic Transfers are created by constructing two or more transactions that are not signed and are written to a file. By not signing the transaction, this allows atomic transfers to be created by one or more parties, possibly at different times. For example, an asset exchange application can create the entire atomic transfer and allow individual parties to sign from their location. The [Offline Transactions](../features/offline_transactions.md#saving-unsigned-transactions-to-file) documentation explains how to create and save individual **unsigned** transactions to a file. 

The SDKs or `goal` can be used to create unsigned transactions.

# Group transactions

Compute the group id of the transactions and assign it the each transaction using tx.Group = gid

``` python tab="Python"
import tensorflow as tf
# get group id and assign it to transactions
gid = transaction.calculate_group_id([txn1, txn2])
txn1.group = gid
txn2.group = gid

```

``` Go tab="Go"
// compute group id and put it into each transaction
gid, err := crypto.ComputeGroupID([]types.Transaction{tx1, tx2})
tx1.Group = gid
tx2.Group = gid

```

``` Java tab=
// compute group id and put it into each transaction
gid, err := crypto.ComputeGroupID([]types.Transaction{tx1, tx2})
tx1.Group = gid
tx2.Group = gid

```

``` Javascript tab=
// compute group id and put it into each transaction
gid, err := crypto.ComputeGroupID([]types.Transaction{tx1, tx2})
tx1.Group = gid
tx2.Group = gid

```
