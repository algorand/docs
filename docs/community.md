# Applications

| Name| Description |
|------|------|
| <center>[AA Notarization](https://github.com/david-ciamberlano/aa-notarization)</center> | Documents can be any type of digital file (MSOffice docs, texts, images, videos, pdf, xml, …). Any document stored in [Alfresco](https://www.alfresco.com/ecm-software/document-management) can be notarized, manually (with a single click) or in a batch process. It’s also possible to check if a previously notarized document is still valid (i.e.: it has not been modified after the notarization). On the technical side, this extension computes the hash (sha256) of a document stored in Alfresco, builds a json object with the hash and other related metadata and creates a transaction in the Algorand blockchain. The json object is stored in the note field of the transaction and a new set of metadata related to that transaction (document hash, block id, transaction id, transaction time, account address) is associated with the document in Alfresco. |
| <center>[AlgoNim](https://github.com/cusma/algonim)</center> | AlgoNim is a very simple mathematical game of strategy for two players. It is cryptographic version of [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) that runs on Algorand Layer 1, directly on the Pure Proof of Stake consensus protocol, so nobody can cheat. The game implementation takes advantage of all the features introduced in Algorand 2.0 protocol: Algorand Standard Assets (ASA), Atomic Transfers (AT) and Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1) using Algorand Python SDK + PyTeal. PyTeal is a binding for TEAL, the stateless bytecode stack-based language for ASC1, in this sense AlgoNim is a truly stateless game. |
| <center>[TrackAlgo](https://github.com/Man-Jain/TrackAlgo)</center> | TrackAlgo is a proof of concept materials tracking application that leverages the "note" field of a payment transaction to store metadata about an item, including things like coordinates and temperature. This showcases how an IoT application would be used in conjunction with the Algorand blockchain. |
| <center>[Tree Certificates](https://github.com/alanmarko/TreeCertificates)</center> | A significant problem with forest conservation and tree planting efforts is that there is currently no way to guarantee that a conserved forest or tree planted would continue to be in existence at some future time. Yet, credit is given at the time of tree planting or when a forest conservation action is taken. This sets up a perverse incentive for a tree planter to make no effort to conserve trees after payment has been received. |
