# reformat.py

Reformats markdown generated by the go spf13/cobra library to work with mkdocs.

Given the `goal` in the path, regenerate the docs from this directory by running:
```
rm -rf ../docs/Reference-Docs/goal
mkdir ../docs/Reference-Docs/goal
goal generate-docs ../docs/Reference-Docs/goal
./reformat.py -path ../docs/Reference-Docs/goal -cmd goal
```
